This software is configured for a 2-person, 10 minute+ performance of "reservoirs". python3 and SuperCollider must be installed on the computer running sound, 
along with a 2 in/out (minimum) audio interface. 

reservoirs_main1.1.scd should be opened first and includes instructions at the top for starting the sound/analysis servers and loading the necessary libraries. 
soundServer.scd will need to be updated with the appropriate audio devices in the top lines of the code block.

The software can easily be reconfigured for different durations and for larger numbers of performers. Please email me at john.p.eagle@gmail.com with any 
requests or help running the software.
